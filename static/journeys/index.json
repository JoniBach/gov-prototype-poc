Applicants can enter their personal details, confirm identity information, provide addresses and medical declarations, and pay the required fee. The service validates eligibility (including age and residency), checks details against existing government records where possible, and submits the application to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) for processing.
